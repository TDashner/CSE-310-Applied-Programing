### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
<!-- Response Here -->
Breaking down the tasks into smaller chunks and focusing on one feature at a time worked really well. I also found that using SQLite's interactive mode helped me understand how my queries worked and troubleshoot errors faster.

- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
<!-- Response Here -->

Trying to rush through the database setup and skip documentation led to confusion and errors later on
- How can you improve in the next module?

<!-- Create this Markdown to a PDF and submit it. In visual
studio code you can convert this to a pdf with any one of the

I want to make sure to get the youtube videos done, as well as having more time for debugging and testing my code
