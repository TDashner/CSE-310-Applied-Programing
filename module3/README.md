# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly exploring new programming languages and their features to enhance my development skills. This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C#, designed to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, struct-based data management, and file operations in the C# language.

The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The program follows C# best practices, using classes, structs, exception handling, loops, and conditionals to create a functional and interactive console-based game. Additionally, it includes file handling, where the results of each game are stored in a file called game_results.txt.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I could probably create a better GUI for the game
- I could add an undo move
- I could also add a loop for users to replay the game instead of having to restart everything
