### Did you complete a Stretch Challenge 
If you completed a stretch challenge, describe what you completed.
For the stretch challenge, I had my program provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for your program instead of the command line.

### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  I learned that trial and error was the best for this module. I was able to find new and different ways to code and I had to find which one worked for my code specifically
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  I tried to incorporate a  "Change Encryption Key" button but I didn't quite understand how it worked or what it was for.
- How can you improve in the next module?
  I want to try this on a seperate computer instead of it being on the same computer using a split terminal
