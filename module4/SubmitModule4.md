### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
<!-- Response Here -->
  I broke the problem into small tasks while using pandas documentation and I was testing code in increments so that I could figure out what I was doing wrong and how to learn easier

- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  <!-- Response Here -->
  I tried to implement sentiment analysis without testing on a small subset and got very confused confusion. I also had many errors, but was able to use chatGPT to tell me what my errors meant so that I could fix accordingly

- How can you improve in the next module?
  <!-- Response Here -->

I want to make sure I put my files in easy to access places so that the path tp get to them is simple and won't create errors.
