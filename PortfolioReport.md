### As you have worked individually and as part of team to learn new things and
implement various software projects for your Personal Software Portfolio, how have
your technical skills improved?

I have loved adding my past knowledge from college classes and implementing them into both the team and the individual modules. My technical skills have improved in ways of personal research, group communication, and problem solving. Working in a team has helped me learn new programming languages I hadn't used before and I feel more confident in tackling unfamiliar topics. 

### Identify at least one project you did in this course that you want to continue
to improve after this course. What is your next step?

I would love to keep improving the web app my team and I made together. My next step would be to better myself in vite and firebase, like my team members were doing. I would want to learn these skills myself and improve my coding through improving the web app along the way. 

### Look back at the Learning Skills survey and goal you wrote in the Course Plan
from the first week. How have your learning skills improved? What do you want to
work on next to improve your ability to learn?

I have learned so much more than when I started this semester. I have learned how to set apart proper time and had a plan for every little thing I had to do for both the individual modules and the team project. I want to later on improve my ability to learn new study habits and how to push myself towards more advanced topics.
