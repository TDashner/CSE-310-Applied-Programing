## Indiviual Response
### Retrospective
What was at least one connection you made in this class to the Gospel of Jesus
Christ?
In what ways has this class better helped you understand your role as a deciple of
Christ in the workforce?
In what ways has this class improved your confidence in recieving and preparing for
an internship?

I was blessed with an amazing team and an even awesome-er teacher as support. We felt like a working family and we were very close to each other. I think the light of Christ was able to be seen in our faces everytime we showed up to class because we enjoyed each other's company so much. I know that every person on this team had their own role, and even if mine was to help support and encourage my other team members, I will do that duty to the best of my abilities to make this team run smoothly through out this project. I feel more and more prepared for an internship solely because of the dedication and work put into it. I feel proud of what I have accomplished and I am excited to share what I have done and show my achievements to any internships available. 

### Challenges
What was your greatest challenge you faced while building the project.
How would you approach the challenge differently if you were faced with it or a
similar challenge in the future?

A big challenge for me was learning how to use my terminal to update, download, switch directories, and fix mistakes I made along the way. Learning how to use GitHub in the beginning was also a major difficulty, especially in my group. One for me I felt was really difficult was putting css onto the site when main wasn't merged with everyones completed components yet. I felt like I was constantly making css for old versions of what my teammates were making and it constantly had to be updated and matched with theirs in order for the css to match up. 

### Praise
Which person (or persons) on your team deserve special recognition for doing great
work? **Make sure that they know how much you appreciate their efforts!**

I would say that Celeste did amazing with the css, Isaiah and Jacob with firebase, Joseph with the contact us page, Holden with the vite and main habitling compnent page, and Hannah with the sprites. They each did amazing at their parts and really made this team a whole. 

### Improvements
How did you help struggling team members along the way? This could be things that
you did to encrouage their engagement in the project.

I think most of the help was going towards me and making sure everything was downloaded and updated properly as well as keeping up with all of github. I had a hard time doing that myself. I think I mostly tried to help Hannah out in the baginning and had her help me pick out the color schemes so that she felt included. Later down the line, I made sure to stay after class a little bit every once in a while to help out Isaiah with last minute squash and merging needing to be done and counted as one of the two approvals that he needed.
