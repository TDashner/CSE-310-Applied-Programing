### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
<!-- Detail the risk here -->
Finding a suitable dataset that is organized and has the information I need

##### Action Plan
<!-- Detail the plan to over come the risk here -->
Merge multiple datasets or check it on pandas

#### Risk 2
<!-- Detail the risk here -->
Dataset might have missing or tampered information

##### Action Plan
<!-- Detail the plan to over come the risk here -->
Use a trusted site for the datasets
